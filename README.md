# Uncommon HTML Bug: Incorrect innerHTML Replacement

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the incorrect usage of `innerHTML` in HTML. The bug arises when attempting to replace the content of a div element using `innerHTML` without proper handling of existing child elements or event listeners.

## Bug Description
The original HTML code uses `innerHTML` to replace the entire content of a div. This method not only replaces the text content but also removes any associated event listeners, styles, or other attributes of the original div element, leading to unexpected behaviour and potential data loss if the div was associated with any dynamic content.

## Solution
The solution involves utilizing methods that modify or append content without replacing the entire element. This can be achieved using methods like `textContent` or by manipulating child nodes directly.
